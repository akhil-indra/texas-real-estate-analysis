#  Texas Residential Real Estate Price Analysis üè°

This project is about understanding what actually drives house prices in Texas. I used real-world data from over 500 residential property listings and built multiple regression models using Stata to analyze how different features ‚Äî like square footage, number of bathrooms, year built, and property type ‚Äî affect a home's listing price.

The goal wasn‚Äôt just to run stats ‚Äî I wanted to answer real questions:  
- Why do some homes cost way more than others?  
- Is square footage always worth more?  
- Do more bathrooms actually raise the price?  
- Does age help or hurt a home's value?  
- Do townhouses, mobile homes, or single-family homes behave differently in the market?

### How I approached it

I cleaned and transformed the dataset, built several econometric models, and tested for things like multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, and model fit. I also log-transformed key variables to make the results interpretable as elasticities.

Then I experimented with:
- **Interaction terms** (e.g., sqft √ó property type)
- **Quadratic terms** (to check diminishing returns)
- **Dummy variables** for property type and city

These allowed me to explore not just direct effects, but how different variables combine or behave in non-linear ways.

---

### What I found

The final model (Model 4) gave the best balance of interpretability and accuracy.

- **Square footage** and **full bathrooms** had the most consistent, positive effect on listing price.
- **Bedrooms** showed diminishing returns ‚Äî adding more bedrooms only helped up to a point.
- **Newer homes** gained value, but the relationship wasn‚Äôt linear. Very new or very old homes had unique effects.
- **Property type** mattered a lot ‚Äî mobile homes, townhomes, and farms were priced significantly lower than single-family homes.

**Adjusted R¬≤: 0.645**

### üìà Quick View of Results and Output of Different Models

| Variable             | Effect Summary                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `ln(sqft)`           | Strong positive ‚Äì every 1% increase raises price by ~0.55%  
| `ln(baths_full)`     | Strong positive ‚Äì highly significant  
| `ln(beds)`           | Weak linear effect, stronger quadratic term  
| `ln(year_built)`     | Negative initially, but positive in squared term (nonlinear)  
| `type_new` dummies   | Significant drops for townhomes, mobile homes, farms

### Why this mattered to me

This wasn‚Äôt just a class assignment. It taught me how to take raw, messy data and turn it into something that can answer a real-world question with confidence.

It forced me to think like a data analyst:
- How do I clean and prep this data right?
- Which model actually makes sense here?
- How do I explain this so someone in real estate (or policy) actually gets it?

This project gave me full-cycle experience, from analysis to insight, and sharpened both my technical and storytelling skills.
